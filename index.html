<project-info>DJ GRAN SPORT is an artist who spent most of his life transient between Chicago, Illinois & Memphis, Tennessee. Since a young age, SPORT would travel between the two cities he calls home collecting mixtapes and inspiration on his travels. I created a cassette artwork as well as a digital artwork for the EP.</project-info></project>

<project-info>With the help of a Generative Adversarial Network — trained on a data set of chrometype logos – new logos are generated.
ChromeGAN researches if an artwork can be generated with no designer at all.</project-info></project>
<project><h2>Die Wichtigkeit des Banalen — Die Tür</h2><project-image><img src=/uploads/ef3-placeholder-image-1.jpg></project-image>
<project-info>»Die Wichtigkeit des Banalen — Die Tür« (The importance of the trivial — The door) is a project about an object we encounter everyday in many different ways: we pass them, we decorate them, we make them safe and safer, we bang them. It is a project about the door, what it means to us and our lives.
The project consists of ten posters in the size of 1 × 2 meters. These posters are stacked behind each other and every now and then the poster shown changes. Every design is based on a found text fragment from various sources (for example ZEIT Magazine), which are used without the context of the original text. The fragment is selected by the way it tells about the door: sometimes it's a metaphor, sometimes it's a peculiar situation happening at doors, sometimes it just describes the object. The text is then translated into typography and graphics, always using the colors black, white, blue-violet and magenta.
These ten are part of a series of 56 other poster designs, which are presented in a white book. This layflat book is bound by hand and designed in a very simple way. The books main part is the typography (Sequel Sans by Oliver Jeschke), a typeface in the fashion of Swiss design. By using a purposeful, modernist type the poster designs come to the front — the editorial design is reduced to a bare minimum in order to not distract from the actual graphics. It's furthermore produced to not close fully: it's always a bit open, like some doors tend to do. The white paper imitates the daily usage of a door. After a while, it becomes dirty and looks like being opened many times — as does the door.</project-info></project>
<project><h2>Good Die My Friend</h2><project-info>In the tragicomedy „Good Die My Friend“ a supposedly trivial competition between two neighbors comes to an escalation. Disregarding their surroundings, both of them destroy, driven by greed, their own habitat until a catastrophe is inevitable.
The short movie has a most human behavior at its core. Greed keeps the man alive and makes him strive for more. It defeats the will to survive: the man builds a chaos and wallows in it. And he does not change anything until a point is reached, where surviving isn't possible anymore. But does he learn from his past or does he simply change the environment to start the chaos all over again?
The animation was created frame by frame (with some digital aid). The technique was used to emphasize the handcraft, the man can choose what he builds and how he designs his surroundings. The illustration style appears infantile and reminds us of cave paintings — the primal instincts of the human are embedded in this style.
We decided to use color sparingly. The texture was created from different pictures of Plasticine and colored in After Effects. They give the picture some more movement and emphasize different parts of the scene. Plasticine was used because it is a formable material, like the human forms his surroundings.</project-info></project>
<project><h2>PL—AGV3</h2><project-image><img src=/uploads/3ac06175283517-5cb19096f0f0f.png></project-image>
<project-info>The PL-AGV3 body suit deals with the increasing pollution of our lives. Climate change dries up the soil, causes the sun to burn from the sky, temperatures rise and large ice deposits melt. There are strong droughts on one side and devastating floods on the other. But the pollution does not just come from the environment. Every day we are bombarded with advertising and products. People dictate to us what is good, what we have to buy, what we need to look like. Hate is on the increase and people are becoming more and more divided. People stop vaccinating their children against dangerous diseases, and so come back deadly dangers. War is no longer conducted on the field, but with chemical and biological weapons from afar. Water and food are contaminated and unconsumable.
The PL-AGV3 body suit draws a picture of how protection against these influences could look like in a dystopian future. A hooded jacket made of a radiation-protective, waterproof, acid-resistant and epidemic-protecting material keeps dangers from the outside. PROTURBO closures keep the suit securely closed. The BEAK with digital e-TRIBAL filters the air and mixes it with a powerful gas. The HUD shows environmental data for a perfect orientation in a broken landscape. An additional HEALTH MONITOR provides a quick overview of your own vital data. The TEAM BADGE shows an assignment to a specific group — or can be switched off entirely.​​​​​​​
The suit equips the individual for a future without a functioning society, without humanity and compassion.</project-info></project>
