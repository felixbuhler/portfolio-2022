description: >
  Sag, Meister is the result of a three-month preoccupation with the famous
  designer Stefan Sagmeister. The project consists of 4 augmented posters for a
  fictional talk series that each display on important aspect of Sagmeisters
  work or person.


  The task was to embed our own design heroes spirit into our the work.
  Sagmeisters work is often typographically. He uses analog means to create very
  special, »sagmeistery« artworks. This is the concept behind every poster: use
  Sagmeisters methods to create some kind of work about his very self.
