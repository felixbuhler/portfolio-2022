description = "Sag, Meister is the result of a three-month preoccupation with the famous designer Stefan Sagmeister. The project consists of 4 augmented posters for a fictional talk series that each display on important aspect of Sagmeisters work or person.\n\nThe task was to embed our own design heroes spirit into our the work. Sagmeisters work is often typographically. He uses analog means to create very special, _sagmeistery_artworks. This is the concept behind every poster: use Sagmeisters methods to create some kind of work about his very self."
