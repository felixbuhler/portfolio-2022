  In five exhibition chapters, the works of twenty international digital artists
  contextualize the relationship between society and new media. The online show
  brings together art that illuminates the virtual as a medium and pushes the
  boundaries of technology. The show’s movens is to promote critical reflection
  on the power that digital tools seem to have over us today: In times of
  omnipresent social media, online tools and the corporations behind them are
  gaining unprecedented influence. At the same time, the »metaverse« also offers
  space for our voices and our actions – in occupying this seemingly limitless
  space, they can complement, overlap, and connect to form a network.\n\nThe
  exhibition thus offers a place where virtual art can be experienced in its
  natural environment. At the same time, it is a vehicle to better understand
  the analog world and the global society away from keyboard (AFK).\n\nThe
  virtual exhibition »Expanded Realities and Networked Voices. Envisioning the
  Ambiguity of Both Utopian and Dystopian Futures« was curated by Eva Fischer
  and Martina Menegon, designed and implemented by Maximilian Prag, graphics
  Marlene Kager.


  Eva Fischer is an independent curator, cultural manager and lecturer in the
  field of audiovisual, immersive art and experimental media. She studied art
  history and cultural management in Graz, Utrecht (NL) and Vienna. Since 2006
  she has been working as a freelance curator. Since 2021 she has been leading
  the new Viennese media art festival CIVA – Contemporary Immersive Virtual Art,
  which is 100% online and virtual in its first year of existence. In 2020 she
  founded the virtual exhibition platform »Area for Virtual Art« together with a
  team of artists, designers and cultural managers (a cooperation of sound:frame
  and Pausanio).


  I created an interactive WebVR video for the event.
