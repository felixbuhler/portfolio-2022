TEN+NINE ( 95 ) is a graphic collection and exploration.

Designed in 2023 by Felix Buhler, it is a platform for diverse exploration of the term "design", sometimes fully developed, sometimes only as an approach. From 3D print files to graphic posters and objects, the works are inspired by Berlin, the zeitgeist, music and new technologies.
