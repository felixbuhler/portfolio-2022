description: "A modular design system was created for the work exhibition of the MD14, Media Design course at the DHBW Ravensburg. A5 fields, combined as desired, are assembled into posters and a guidance system. The use of chrome paper reflects the environment and the monochrome design illuminates in the entire color spectrum.\nThe DIN A5 format enabled us to create a signage system that could be quickly adapted to meet specific requirements. For example, during the course of the work show, we designed directional arrows and printed them out in black and white on our copiers.\n\nArt Direction\_[Tobias MÃ¼ller]()\_[Nicolas Bernklau]()\_[Felix Buhler]()\_[Tobias Tapken]()\_\n\nSupervision\_[Prof. Dr. Klaus Birk]() \n\nWeb Design & Coding\_[Florian Windbacher]()\_\n\nAnimated Posters\_[Hanna Viellehner]()\_\n\nSocial Media\_[Dario Suppan]()\n"
