  A modular design system was created for the work exhibition of the MD14, Media
  Design course at the DHBW Ravensburg. A5 fields, combined as desired, are
  assembled into posters and a guidance system. The use of chrome paper reflects
  the environment and the monochrome design illuminates in the entire color
  spectrum.

  The DIN A5 format enabled us to create a signage system that could be quickly
  adapted to meet specific requirements. For example, during the course of the
  work show, we designed directional arrows and printed them out in black and
  white on our copiers.
