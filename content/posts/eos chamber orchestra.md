description: >
  The eos chamber orchestra develops progressive concepts beyond the traditional
  concert business: Genre boundaries are overturned, new worlds of sound are
  created. Formdusche created a branding that translates eos' approach in a
  visible form. Abstract, fluid forms generate a cosmos of light, color and
  spatial depth.
