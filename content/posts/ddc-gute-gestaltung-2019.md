description = "For the 2019 edition of the DDC MAG, the aim was not »be different«, but »fit to use«. Inspiration was found in the architecture collective Brandlhuber+. Its approach: conquering places and building spaces by reusing or changing what is given. Material focus: concrete. In the middle of the COVID lockdown, we got our hands dirty in the home office, creating molds and forming letters from concrete. Fascinated by the special features of the concrete artifacts, we ask the question: How do we want to live? What comes after the concrete?"
