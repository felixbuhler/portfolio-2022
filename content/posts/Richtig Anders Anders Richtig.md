description: "ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyscalculia, mental health\_— in their new non-fiction book, award-winning authors\_Kathrin Köller and Irmela Schautz\_dive into the world of\_neurodiversity. Following their success with\_Queergestreift, this book is empowering, stylish, and deeply human.\n\nFrom early childhood, society expects everyone to \"function\" the same way. But neurodivergent people—whether they have ADHD, autism, or learning differences—often face misunderstanding and pressure to conform. Köller and Schautz challenge these norms and show that different brains are not wrong, just wired differently.\n\nThe book invites young readers (and adults alike) to see neurodiversity as a natural and valuable part of human variation. It’s both an educational journey and a passionate call for greater acceptance, inclusion, and self-confidence.\\\n\\\nCreated as Art Director as part of the team of [formdusche](https://formdusche.de \"formdusche\").\n"
