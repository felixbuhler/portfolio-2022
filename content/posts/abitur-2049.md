description = "In Germany, it is a tradition for high school graduates to design a T-shirt that reminds them of their school days. Often, funny sayings are used. »Abitur 2049« resembles such a T-Shirt, but transfers the concept to the future. What have we survived? Certainly more than strict teachers, heavy homework and school days."
