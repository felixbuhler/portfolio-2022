description = "The PL-AGV3 body suit deals with the increasing pollution of our lives. Climate change dries up the soil, causes the sun to burn from the sky, temperatures rise and large ice deposits melt. There are strong droughts on one side and devastating floods on the other. But the pollution does not just come from the environment. Every day we are bombarded with advertising and products. People dictate to us what is good, what we have to buy, what we need to look like. Hate is on the increase and people are becoming more and more divided. People stop vaccinating their children against dangerous diseases, and so come back deadly dangers. War is no longer conducted on the field, but with chemical and biological weapons from afar. Water and food are contaminated and unconsumable.\n\nThe PL-AGV3 body suit draws a picture of how protection against these influences could look like in a dystopian future. A hooded jacket made of a radiation-protective, waterproof, acid-resistant and epidemic-protecting material keeps dangers from the outside. PROTURBO closures keep the suit securely closed. The BEAK with digital e-TRIBAL filters the air and mixes it with a powerful gas. The HUD shows environmental data for a perfect orientation in a broken landscape. An additional HEALTH MONITOR provides a quick overview of your own vital data. The TEAM BADGE shows an assignment to a specific group — or can be switched off entirely.​​​​​​​\n\nThe suit equips the individual for a future without a functioning society, without humanity and compassion."
