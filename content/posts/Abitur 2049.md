description: >
  In Germany, it is a tradition for high school graduates to design a T-shirt
  that reminds them of their school days. Often, funny sayings are used. »Abitur
  2049« resembles such a T-Shirt, but transfers the concept to the future. What
  have we survived? Certainly more than strict teachers, heavy homework and
  school days.
