description = "DJ GRAN SPORT is an artist who spent most of his life transient between Chicago, Illinois & Memphis, Tennessee. Since a young age, SPORT would travel between the two cities he calls home collecting mixtapes and inspiration on his travels.   \nLiving much of his life feeling like an outcast, SPORT recalls the fact that he never felt fully accepted or apart of either scene but would often observe from a distance and regularly attended rap events in Memphis and House parties in Chicago to gain inspiration as a fly on the wall. \n\nHis years producing alone helped him piece together a sound that can be easily recognised as a collision of the two cities sonically but also a sound that was rarely touched upon in his time and a style that even today is uniquely his own. In his own words the Memphis House release was originally made for the long drive back to Chicago after visiting family in Memphis, something to remind him of home and at the same time keep him awake and alert.   \n  \nThis collision of lo-fi house rhythms laced with Memphis rap's gully/dark soundscapes set the groundwork for the Memphis House series that was originally released on 40 cassettes in 2004 by DJ GRAN SPORT's cousin. Sadly the release was meet with little to no acclaim and the release along with DJ GRAN SPORT's love for producing slowly diminished.   \n  \nBy pure luck a friend of the Cosmic family came across one of these rare cassettes at a boot sale in Chicago in 2017 and sent it to us to see if we knew anything about the artist. We were instantly blown away by what we heard and we're in awe at the age of the productions and unknown nature of the artist and his music.  \n  \nAll tracks are re-edited/remixed by DJ GRAN SPORT between 1995–2004.\n\nBuy the [album](https://cosmic-compositions.bandcamp.com/album/memphis-house \"Memphis House on Bandcamp\")."
