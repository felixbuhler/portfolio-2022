description: >
  DJ GRAN SPORT is an artist who spent most of his life transient between
  Chicago, Illinois & Memphis, Tennessee. Since a young age, SPORT would travel
  between the two cities he calls home collecting mixtapes and inspiration on
  his travels.   \nLiving much of his life feeling like an outcast, SPORT
  recalls the fact that he never felt fully accepted or apart of either scene
  but would often observe from a distance and regularly attended rap events in
  Memphis and House parties in Chicago to gain inspiration as a fly on the wall.
  \n\nHis years producing alone helped him piece together a sound that can be
  easily recognised as a collision of the two cities sonically but also a sound
  that was rarely touched upon in his time and a style that even today is
  uniquely his own. In his own words the Memphis House release was originally
  made for the long drive back to Chicago after visiting family in Memphis,
  something to remind him of home and at the same time keep him awake and alert.

  This collision of lo-fi house rhythms laced with Memphis rap's gully/dark
  soundscapes set the groundwork for the Memphis House series that was
  originally released on 40 cassettes in 2004 by DJ GRAN SPORT's cousin.\

  All tracks are re-edited/remixed by DJ GRAN SPORT between 1995–2004.\n\nBuy
