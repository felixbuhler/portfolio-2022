description = "With digitization, our world seems to be becoming increasingly dematerialized. Nevertheless, it is the materiality of things that allows for an experiential space of action. Physical interfaces thus serve as mediators and communication carriers in the dialog between humans and abstract machines. While in the past the distribution of roles was still clear - the human being acts, the machine functions - we are increasingly experiencing that we \"co-function\" with things and that they \"co-act\" with us. These hybrid artifacts - between analog and digital - escape the digital world and become actors in a physical environment. Only by confronting us and rubbing up against them do the things become part of our consciousness and allow for an experiential space of action.\n\nAndreas Muxel studied Communication Design at the University of Applied Sciences Vorarlberg and Media Arts at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne. In his experimental works he deals with the intertwining of code and material and human-machine interaction. His works at the intersection of design, art and science have been exhibited and awarded internationally many times (including Ars Electronica Festival Linz, FILE Festival São Paulo, TodaysArt Festival Brussels, VIDA Award Madrid, Share Price Turin).\n\nIn 2015 founded the design studio \"NEOANALOG\" focusing on the development and design of hybrid artifacts and spaces. From 2013 to 2017 Andreas Muxel was professor for Interface Design at the Köln International School of Design at TH Köln. Since the winter semester 2017/2018 he is professor for research and teaching in »Physical Human-Machine Interface«\" at the Faculty of Design Hochschule Augsburg."
