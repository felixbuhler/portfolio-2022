description: >
  In the tragicomedy „Good Die My Friend“ a supposedly trivial competition
  between two neighbors comes to an escalation. Disregarding their surroundings,
  both of them destroy, driven by greed, their own habitat until a catastrophe
  is inevitable.\n\nThe short movie has a most human behavior at its core. Greed
  keeps the man alive and makes him strive for more. It defeats the will to
  survive: the man builds a chaos and wallows in it. And he does not change
  anything until a point is reached, where surviving isn't possible anymore. But
  does he learn from his past or does he simply change the environment to start
  the chaos all over again?


  The animation was created frame by frame (with some digital aid). The
  technique was used to emphasize the handcraft, the man can choose what he
  builds and how he designs his surroundings. The illustration style appears
  infantile and reminds us of cave paintings — the primal instincts of the human
  are embedded in this style.


  We decided to use color sparingly. The texture was created from different
  pictures of Plasticine and colored in After Effects. They give the picture
  some more movement and emphasize different parts of the scene. Plasticine was
  used because it is a formable material, like the human forms his surroundings.
